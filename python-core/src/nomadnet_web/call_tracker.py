"""
LXST telephony-announce tracker.

Phase 0 of a real voice-call feature: this listens for RNS announces on
the "lxst.telephony" aspect and records which identities have ever shown
up as call-capable — nothing about placing or receiving an actual call
yet, just "does this contact's client support it," surfaced as a phone
icon on their card (ConversationRow.kt). The aspect string, destination
shape, and identity-vs-destination-hash relationship below were verified
directly against markqvist/LXST's real source (LXST/__init__.py's
APP_NAME = "lxst", LXST/Primitives/Telephony.py's
RNS.Destination(identity, IN, SINGLE, APP_NAME, "telephony")) — not
guessed. The actual audio I/O backend needed to place a call is a much
larger, separate effort (see the nomadportal-android-competitor-research
memory: LXST's own Android audio code is pyjnius/Kivy-only, incompatible
with this app's Chaquopy architecture — a genuine from-scratch rewrite,
not integration work).

Keyed by *identity* hash, not destination hash. A single RNS.Identity
produces a different destination hash per aspect it announces under
(destination hash is derived from identity + aspect together) — so this
identity's "lxst.telephony" destination hash is NOT the same value as
its "lxmf.delivery" destination hash, even though it's the same person.
The identity's own `.hash` (independent of aspect) is what's shared
across both, so that's the correlation key: `_LXMFAnnounceHandler`
(lxmf_tracker.py) was extended to also capture each LXMF peer's
`identity_hash`, and orchestrator.py's `_conversation_entries()` cross-
references that against `get_call_capable_hashes()` here.

Same batched-persistence design as LXMFPeerTracker, for the same reason
(see that module's own doc comment for the real GIL-contention bug
inline persistence caused) — lower expected announce volume here (not
every LXMF client also runs LXST), but no reason to risk the same class
of bug for a brand-new feature.
