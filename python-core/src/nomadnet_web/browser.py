# from a slow patch. 120s keeps a "loading spinner while the mesh is

        TCP errors (``ConnectionResetError``, ``BrokenPipeError``, etc.)
        don't permanently disable the interface.

        RNS 1.1.3's TCPClientInterface catches every exception from
        ``socket.sendall`` and calls ``self.teardown()``. That flips
        ``IN``/``OUT`` to False. The read_loop separately detects the
        closed socket and fires ``reconnect()`` — which brings
        ``online`` back to True, but does NOT reset ``IN``/``OUT``.
        Result: an interface stuck in a zombie state where
        ``online=True`` (data still flows in) but
        ``Transport.outbound()`` silently refuses to send anything ever
        again on it. The only way to reset the flags is a full RNS
        restart, which in a container context means restarting the
        container.

        Why this happens more than you'd think: any transient TCP RST
        from a PMTU boundary crossing, VPN tunnel churn, or ISP
        middlebox will trigger the exception path. In deployments
        behind a VPN with a low tunnel MTU (Gluetun-with-WireGuard is
        the reproducer we found), it happens within minutes of the
        first fetch that generates any packet close to the MTU limit.

        Fix: catch the transient TCP errors specifically and route
        recovery through the socket-close + read_loop.reconnect path,
        which preserves ``IN``/``OUT``. Truly-unexpected exceptions
        still fall through to the original teardown behaviour.
